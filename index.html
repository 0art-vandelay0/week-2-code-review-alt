            <div id="python" class="hidden">
                <p class="boldLarge">You should try <span class="uppercase">Python!</span></p>
                <p>Python is more readable than most languages because it uses a simplified syntax with clear and
                    intuitive keywords and structures, making it easier to understand and follow even for those new
                    to
                    coding.</p>
                <p>Python has extensive community support and a rapidly growing popularity among developers, making
                    it highly sought after in the job market for its wide range of applications, from web
                    development and data analysis to machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>Python is a great language for database managment and back-end web development with frameworks
                    like
                    Flask and Django.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="javaScript" class="hidden">
                <p class="boldLarge">You should try <span class="uppercase">Javascript!</span></p>
                <p>JavScript provides powerful built-in tools for manipulating the webpage DOM, making it a great
                    front-end web development language. It is also natively supported by browsers.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a versitle language and offers excellent cross-platform compatibility, allowing
                    developers to write code once and run it seamlessly across different operating systems and
                    devices, including desktops, mobile devices, and even embedded systems.</p>
                <p>JavaScript's widespread adoption and support makes it the de facto language for web development,
                    with an extensive ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools available.</p>

            <div id="rust" class="hidden">
                <p class="boldLarge">You should try <span class="uppercase">Rust!</span></p>
                <p>Rust prioritizes performance and safety, offering faster execution speeds and early detection of
                    common errors through strict compile-time checks. It is an excellent choice for
                    performance-critical systems programming and projects that require reliability.</p>
                <p>Rust's unique ownership system enables efficient memory management without a garbage collector,
                    making it ideal for low-level programming requiring precise memory control.</p>
